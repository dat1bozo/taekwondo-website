Other blocks (such as dollmyo makgi) are not as practical, and shouldn't really be used in sparring. As a genral rule, The body is turned 45°. All blocks are also performed at middle height (kaunde).</dd>

                <dd>Hand strikes are rather self explanitory, but we'll go into a little more depth. A hand strike generally is using the hands to land a hit on another person (most commonly a punch). The primary muscles involved in a straight or thrusting motion of the upper body are the frontal deltoids and the triceps. Ditto the last except biceps instead of triceps for swinging motions (like inward ridge hand).</dd>
